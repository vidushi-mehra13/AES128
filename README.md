# AES128
AES-GCM Encryption in Python This script encrypts and decrypts a message using AES in GCM mode for authenticated encryption. A 256-bit key is securely derived from a password using the scrypt key derivation function with a random salt. It ensures data confidentiality and integrity using nonce and authentication tags.
